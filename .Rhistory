aboutme: Over the past 3 years I have been working as a Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission contractor for Tacoma Power. I regularly perform various fisheries technician duties (i.e., spawning ground surveys, PIT tagging, biosampling, fish identification and enumeration, etc.). In the past 2 years my duties have shifted to allow for more focus on data analysis, data visualization and continued education with various data softwares. I primarily use R, ArcGIS Pro, Tableau and Snowflake to complete various data visualization projects. I have a deep seeded passion for data science, data visualization and automation.
